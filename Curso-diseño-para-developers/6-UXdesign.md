# UX design (User Experience design)🎨✨

It center on the users and the usability of our software👩‍💻

> "If we want to users likes our software, we should design it to behave like a good person: responsible, generous, and collaborator."

A lot of time we enter on a web o app where doing task is really hard❌ (pay a bill💸, etc.) all this problems are because they dont have a good UX design😒.

The UX design have different steps😲:

* Investigation🔎: in this step we recopilate data about how the user behave and how they uses any different existing app, this is usefull to build a product that really solves the problems of the final users.

* Analisis🧐: here we classificate the information, group and define the objectives on users level.

* Design🖋: we create prototypes, user flow and a lot of thing that allow us to know what are the best practices for our final users.

* user test👩‍💻: this tests are generally built on paper, or interactive prototypes, this allow us to adjust our design before get the step to development.
